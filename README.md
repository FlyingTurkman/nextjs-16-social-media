This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# About Project
This project was prepared for you to examine the cache component and suspense structure in Next.js 16.
After running the project, you can fully observe how the cache component affects page load speed by enabling the “Disable cache” option in the Network settings inside DevTools.
To examine how Suspense works, you can select options like “Slow 4G” in the Network settings.
In this project, the skeleton loading part is completely simulated.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
